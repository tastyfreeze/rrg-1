## Heritage Features

The Red River Gorge has both archaeological and historical features within it. Rock shelters were used by prehistoric people, and, if undisturbed, may contain clues to their culture. Camping, digging, and firebuilding are prohibited in rock shelters in the Gorge and the rest of the Daniel Boone National Forest. Gladie Historic Site features a reconstructed cabin from the late 1800s, interpreting aspects of life in that era.
