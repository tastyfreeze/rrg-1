## Copperas Creek Falls

Approaching the falls on Copperas Creek is deceptive -- you can hear it before you can see it. The creek turns to the right while the trail goes to the left, up a small rise. There in the distance, through the rhododendron leaves, you can see the falls pouring over the rocky edge, but you can't see how tall it is.

Coming a little closer, its height is more apparent.

The falls pours over a narrow area of the rock shelf, but the shelf itself creates a rock shelter which curves around almost a third of the shallow plunge pool. The pool area is sandy, and sand and rock cover the slope up under the rock shelf.

I did not use an application to measure the falls at the site, but I did measure it from the ArcGIS Pro 3-D scene, at about 43 feet tall, and, from the pictures, it seems about 5 or 6 feet wide on that day. The website [Kentucky Waterfalls](http://kywaterfalls.com/dir/index.php/cumberland-plateau/1806-copperas-creek-falls) gives the height as 42 feet.  

On the right when facing the falls is a steep hill made of material which has fallen over time from the overhanging edge. From this angle one can get a good view of the size of the rock shelter.

You also can see a bit of the landscape around the top of the falls.
