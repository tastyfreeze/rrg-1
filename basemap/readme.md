Copperas Creek, near Sky Bridge Rd. (rt. 715)

## Copperas Creek Falls

Approaching the falls on Copperas Creek is deceptive -- you can hear it before you can see it. The creek turns to the right while the trail goes to the left, up a small rise. There in the distance, through the rhododendron leaves, you can see the falls pouring over the rocky edge, but you can't see how tall it is.

Coming a little closer, its height is more apparent.
